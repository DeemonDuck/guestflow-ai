# GuestFlow AI — README.md

# 🏨 GuestFlow AI

GuestFlow AI is an event-driven hospitality workflow automation platform built using FastAPI, Streamlit, SQLite, RAG architecture, and local LLM inference via Ollama.

The system automates hotel guest workflows across:

* Pre-Stay Operations
* In-Stay Guest Support
* Post-Stay Follow-Up

It uses a multi-agent orchestration architecture to route events dynamically and simulate real-world hospitality automation systems.

# 🎫 Ticket Management API

Guest requests that need follow-up are stored as **tickets** so they can be
tracked through their full lifecycle: `open → in_progress → resolved`.

## List Tickets

```text
GET /tickets               # all tickets
GET /tickets?status=open   # filter by status
```

## Update Ticket Status

```text
PATCH /tickets/{ticket_id}
```

```json
{
  "status": "in_progress"
}
```

Allowed statuses: `open`, `in_progress`, `resolved`.

When a ticket is moved to `resolved`, GuestFlow automatically follows up with the
guest to confirm the issue is actually fixed — closing the loop from request to
resolution. (The follow-up fires only on the transition into `resolved`, so
re-saving a resolved ticket never spams the guest.)

## Escalation Timer

Open tickets that sit unattended too long can be surfaced and escalated to a
manager:

```text
GET  /tickets/escalations?minutes=30        # list stale open tickets (read-only)
POST /tickets/escalations/run?minutes=30     # alert manager about stale tickets
```

Each ticket is escalated at most once (tracked via an `escalated` flag), so
running the escalation repeatedly never re-notifies the same ticket. Point a
scheduler/cron at the `run` endpoint to make escalation automatic.

Staff can also view and update tickets visually from the **🎫 Tickets** tab in
the Streamlit dashboard (filter by status, then change a ticket's state inline).

---

# 👤 Guest Profiles & Preferences

GuestFlow keeps a durable **profile** per guest so repeat visitors are recognised
and personalised — instead of asking the same questions every stay.

A profile stores:

| Field           | Example                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `contact_email` | `sharma@example.com`                 |
| `preferences`   | `High floor, extra pillows, veg meal`|
| `is_vip`        | `true`                               |
| `notes`         | `Anniversary on 12 Aug`              |

Profiles are saved via a **merge upsert**: updating one field never erases the
others, so partial updates are safe. When a guest has a profile, their stored
preferences are injected into the AI prompt for both booking confirmations
(pre-stay) and in-stay requests, so replies are personalised automatically.

VIP prioritisation is **driven by the profile's `is_vip` flag** (no hardcoded
guest list): when a VIP guest raises an in-stay request, the workflow enables
priority handling automatically.

## Profile API

```text
GET  /profiles/{guest_name}     # read a profile (null if none exists)
POST /profiles/{guest_name}     # create or update (merge upsert)
```

```json
{
  "contact_email": "sharma@example.com",
  "preferences": "High floor, extra pillows",
  "is_vip": true,
  "notes": "Anniversary on 12 Aug"
}
```

Staff can also manage profiles visually from the **👤 Profiles** tab in the
Streamlit dashboard: look up a guest by name, and the form pre-fills with any
existing profile so preferences, VIP status and notes can be edited and saved.

# ⭐ Review Management

After checkout, GuestFlow asks every guest for feedback and helps the hotel
protect its rating — **without** any practice that would violate review
platform policies.

## How it works

* Every guest receives a feedback request that includes the public review link
  (when `REVIEW_LINK` is configured). The invitation is **never** conditioned on
  how the guest rates their stay.
* When a guest submits **negative** feedback (a low rating, or a comment with
  negative wording), the manager is privately alerted so they can recover the
  experience quickly.
* That alert is an internal operations signal only — it never blocks, hides or
  diverts the guest's ability to post a public review.

> ⚠️ **Compliance:** selectively soliciting public reviews only from happy
> guests ("review gating") violates Google's review policies and FTC guidance.
> GuestFlow intentionally offers the review invitation to **all** guests; the
> sentiment check is used solely to trigger internal service recovery.

## Feedback API

```text
GET  /feedback                 # list all submitted feedback
POST /feedback/{guest_name}     # submit a rating (1-5) and/or a comment
```

```json
{
  "rating": 2,
  "comment": "The room was not clean."
}
```

Ratings at or below `REVIEW_ALERT_THRESHOLD` (default `3`) flag the feedback as
negative and alert the manager.

Staff can submit and review feedback from the **⭐ Feedback** tab in the
Streamlit dashboard, which shows total/average rating, a negative count, and
flags entries where the manager was alerted.

---

# 📊 Owner Analytics

A single ROI view for the hotel owner, aggregated from the data GuestFlow
already collects:

```text
GET /analytics
```

Returns ticket metrics (total, open / in-progress / resolved, resolution rate,
average resolution time in minutes, escalations) and feedback metrics (total
responses, average rating, positive / negative counts).

The **📊 Analytics** tab in the Streamlit dashboard renders these as at-a-glance
metric cards — the "here's what you're paying for" screen.

---

# ⚙️ Configuration

GuestFlow reads its settings from environment variables (e.g. a `.env` file):

| Variable                            | Purpose                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `GMAIL_SENDER` / `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` | Mailbox used to send notifications                 |
| `GMAIL_RECIPIENT`                   | Default mailbox (fallback when no specific recipient)|
| `MANAGER_EMAIL`                     | Where escalation alerts go (falls back to `GMAIL_RECIPIENT`) |
| `HOTEL_NAME`                        | Hotel name used in guest messaging                   |
| `ESCALATION_MINUTES`                | Default staleness threshold for escalations (default `30`) |
| `API_KEY`                           | If set, all API requests must send it as the `X-API-Key` header |
| `REVIEW_LINK`                       | Public review URL included in every guest feedback request |
| `REVIEW_ALERT_THRESHOLD`            | Ratings at/below this (1-5) alert the manager (default `3`) |

Notifications are routed automatically: **guest-facing messages** (booking
confirmation and resolved-ticket follow-up) go to the guest's stored
`contact_email`, while **escalation alerts** go to `MANAGER_EMAIL`. Each falls
back to `GMAIL_RECIPIENT` when a specific address isn't on file.

## API Authentication

When `API_KEY` is set, every endpoint requires the matching key in an
`X-API-Key` request header (missing/incorrect keys get `401`). When `API_KEY`
is **unset**, authentication is disabled for local development and the server
prints a warning at startup. **Always set `API_KEY` before exposing the API on
a network.** The Streamlit dashboard reads `API_KEY` from the environment and
sends it automatically.

---

# 🧪 Tests

A `pytest` suite covers the core behaviour: ticket lifecycle (creation,
status validation, resolve follow-up firing once, escalation alerting once),
guest profile merge-upsert, review/feedback sentiment + compliance (review link
offered to every guest, manager alerted only on negative feedback), analytics
aggregation, and API key authentication.

```bash
pytest tests/ -q
```

Tests run against an isolated temporary database (no impact on `guestflow.db`)
and stub all outbound email, so the suite sends nothing and touches no real data.
