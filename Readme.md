# GuestFlow AI — README.md

# 🏨 GuestFlow AI

GuestFlow AI is an event-driven hospitality workflow automation platform built using FastAPI, Streamlit, SQLite, RAG architecture, and local LLM inference via Ollama.

The system automates hotel guest workflows across:

* Pre-Stay Operations
* In-Stay Guest Support
* Post-Stay Follow-Up

It uses a multi-agent orchestration architecture to route events dynamically and simulate real-world hospitality automation systems.
